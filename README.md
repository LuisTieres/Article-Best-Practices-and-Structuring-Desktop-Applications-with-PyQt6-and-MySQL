# 📘 Desktop Application Development with PyQt6 and MySQL

## 📖 Description
This repository is part of an academic project and article that presents a structured approach to developing desktop applications using **PyQt6** and **MySQL**.  
The focus is on programming best practices, clean code organization, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), security concepts, and full integration between the graphical interface and the database, resulting in a professional, modular, secure, and scalable software solution.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Apply clean architecture and modular code organization.
- Demonstrate the development of a desktop application using professional design patterns.
- Teach how to integrate **PyQt6** (GUI development) with **MySQL** (data persistence).
- Ensure software security, scalability, and maintainability.

## 🔐 Security and Best Practices

- Apply the **principle of least privilege** to the database
- Use **encryption** for sensitive data when required
- Follow modular and component-based code structure
- Implement proper exception handling and logging
- Separate UI, business logic, and persistence layers
